# Exploring Physiological and Emotional Responses During Virtual Driving

Understanding the Connection Between Physiology and Emotion in Virtual Driving Scenarios

1. **Recording Physiological Signals:** Monitor heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) during driving sessions.
   
2. **Analyzing Driving Behavior:** Investigate driving styles and event management.
   
3. **Assessing Acceleration and Braking:** Study pedal usage and control strategies.
   
4. **Simulating Realistic Driving Environments:** Engage in virtual driving simulations.

Usage Instructions:
1. Unzip the "Driving Experiment.zip" folder to access the contents.
   
2. Experience Competitive Driving Lessons: Utilize the provided .cvs files for telemetry data including driving events and refer to the associated .xlsx files for emotional reports.
   
3. Access Driving Training Data: Utilize .cvs files for telemetry data including virtual game speeds and refer to the associated .xlsx files for emotional reports.

Note: This project delves into physiological and emotional responses during virtual driving. It involves recording HR and EDA, analyzing driving behaviors, and examining pedal usage. The provided data aims to offer insights into the intricate relationship between human physiology, emotion, and virtual driving experiences.
